This is a demo of LostExhaust using twenty users named
after colors. Find each of the users in persons.txt.
To log in, each of the users' usernames is simply their
last name (the color) in lowercase. For example, F.
Fushcia's username is 'fushcia' (without quotes.) The
password that corresponds with a given user is their
username with the number '1' appended. For example,
the password that corresponds with the username
'fushcia' is 'fushcia1' (without quotes.)
